# About the project

Colorado Local Authorities (CoLA) is a project that aims to provide publishing and access services for biographical and historical information about people, organizations, and families of interest to cultural institutions in Colorado and Wyoming. It is complementary to national services in this domain such as [id.loc.gov](https://id.loc.gov) and the [Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC)](http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu) project, and shares goals with other regional name authority efforts underway across the country.

A small website with some sample authority data relevant to the CoLA project scope may be found [here](http://jackflaps.net/cola).
