# Colorado Local Authorities

The Colorado Local Authorities (CoLA) project is a pilot with two goals in mind:

1. Model and publish RDF data for local names of creators and subjects of cultural heritage materials in the Colorado-Wyoming region
2. Lower the barriers for small cultural heritage institutions to contribute their metadata to larger linked data projects

Here are published authority record examples, data dictionaries, and RDF data modeling documents related to the CoLA project.

Questions may be directed to Kevin Clair, Digital Initiatives Librarian at the University of Denver: kevin.clair at du.edu.
